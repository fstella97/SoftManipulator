# Introduction

This repository is intended to provide a reference for the code used in my master thesis on Soft robotics. 
In [Optimal pose-stiffness](https://github.com/fstella97/SoftManipulator/tree/main/Optimal%20pose-stiffness) finds the optimal stiffness and pose for the soft manipulators, while the folder [Hardware control](https://github.com/fstella97/SoftManipulator/tree/main/Hardware%20control) presents the low level motor and stiffness control for the hardware.
The followig code has been developed in Matlab 2020b and requires the package "Gobal Optimization toolbox".

## Installation

The  
```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
